Programming in C/C++ and OpenGL
That's a program based course.

We gonna learn how to program some technics of animation.

First topic we gonna cover is character animation :
- Skeleton animation

Types of animations :
- Skeleton animation
- Motion capture
- Physicaly based animation
- Soft bodies / Cloth simulation

We'll see :
- Transformation methods
- Skinning
- Reverse kinematic == by rotating my arm, my hand will move -> find the rotation of join to have the good location at the -> example a robot arm who try to kick in a specific location.
- Motion capture
- Mesh deformation
	- Sometines physics and skeleton are not so usefull when I want to morph one mesh into a new one. Example, a human to a bird.
- Cloth simulation
- Facial animation
- Fluid simlation
- Particle systems
